Building Qemu
-------------

$ ./getqemu.sh
$ cd qemu-0.12.3
$ make
$ cd ..

Downloading the Linux Kernel
----------------------------

This must be done before busybox is compiled; busybox depends on the linux
headers.

$ cd linux
$ ./getkernel.sh
$ cd ..

Building busybox
----------------

$ cd initrd
$ ./getbusybox.sh
$ cd busybox-1.16.1
$ make CFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32"
$ cp busybox ../sbin

Building initrd
---------------

Change the init script to suit your needs, and put the appropriate benchmark in
the sbin/ directory.

$ make
$ cd ..

Building Linux
--------------

$ cd linux/linux-2.6.34
$ ARCH=i386 make
$ cd ../..

Building Distorm
----------------

This does not require the python dev libraries. Even if it errors out before it
finishes building, as long as you have built the .a file, that is enough.

$ cd distorm/distorm64/build/linux
$ make
$ cd ../../../..

Building Qsim
-------------

Edit the makefile to change prefix to appropriate directory. "sudo" is only
required here if this is not a directory normally writeable by your user (the
default is /usr/local, which is typically not world-writeable).

$ sudo make install

Building QSim Server
--------------------

Again, the makefile must be changed if the QSim installation prefix is not
/usr/local. LD_LIBRARY_PATH must also be set, if the installation prefix is not 
in the usual path, before the server is run.

$ cd remote/server
$ make

Building Examples
-----------------

$ cd examples
$ make

Running Examples
----------------

$ ./simple 1 TRACE
