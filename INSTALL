These instructions are written in bash-ese. Know which shell you're using
(echo $SHELL) and if you're not sure how to translate, perform the install in
a bash session. (Just run "bash" on the command line. It's installed by
default on most Linux distros.)

Building Qemu
-------------

$ ./getqemu.sh
$ cd qemu-0.12.3
$ make
$ cd ..

Downloading the Linux Kernel
----------------------------

This must be done before busybox is compiled; busybox depends on the linux
headers.

$ cd linux
$ ./getkernel.sh
$ cd ..

Building busybox
----------------

$ cd initrd
$ ./getbusybox.sh
$ cd busybox-1.21.1
$ make CFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32"
$ cp busybox ../sbin
$ cd ..

Building initrd
---------------

You can modify the init script to suit your needs. This used to be the way
applications were loaded, but now they're 

$ make
$ cd ..

Building Linux
--------------

$ cd linux/linux-2.6.34
$ make ARCH=i386
$ cd ../..

Building Distorm
----------------

This does not require the python dev libraries. Even if it errors out before it
finishes building, as long as you have built the .a file, that is enough.

$ cd distorm/distorm64/build/linux
$ make
$ cd ../../../..

Building Qsim
-------------

If an install prefix other than /usr/local is required, set the QSIM_PREFIX
environment variable prior to building QSim. "sudo" is only required here if
this is not a directory normally writeable by your user (the default is
/usr/local, which is typically not world-writeable).

Optional, to install in a home directory:

$ mkdir ~/qsim-root
$ mkdir ~/qsim-root/bin
$ mkdir ~/qsim-root/include
$ mkdir ~/qsim-root/lib
$ export QSIM_PREFIX=~/qsim-root

Required:

$ sudo make install

Building a Basic Set of State Files
-----------------------------------

To build state files for 1 through 64 CPUs in powers of two, run:

$ ./mkstate.sh

This script can be modified to produce state files for more or fewer CPUs, or
with different RAM sizes. 3072 megs is necessary to run all of Parsec.

Building QSim Server
--------------------

This makefile also uses the QSIM_PREFIX variable, if it is set, otherwise QSIM
is assumed to reside in /usr/local. Remember to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
running the server, if the installation libary path is not in the library
search path.

$ cd remote/server
$ make
$ cd ../..

There is currently no "install" target for the QSim server, so it must be run
in place or manually copied as desired.

Building/Installing QSim Client Library
---------------------------------------

This also respects QSIM_PREFIX, and will install libqsim-client.so and
qsim-client.h in $QSIM_PREFIX/lib and $QSIM_PREFIX/include respectively.

$ cd remote/client
$ sudo make install
$ cd ../..

Building Examples
-----------------

$ cd examples
$ make
