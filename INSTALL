Installation Instructions
-------------------------

If you are on Ubuntu (>= 14.04) just run setup.sh script in the repository. This
will set up the entire QSim infrastructure. On other distributions, comment the
apt-get lines, install build dependencies for QEMU and run the script. You will
also need an ARM64 cross compiler if you plan to use QSim for ARM64.
