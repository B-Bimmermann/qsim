Installation Instructions
-------------------------

If you are on Ubuntu (>= 14.04) just run setup.sh script in the qsim
directory.  This will set up the entire QSim infrastructure. On other
distributions, comment the apt-get lines, install build dependencies
for QEMU and run the script.

You will need an ARM64 cross compiler if you plan to use QSim for
ARM64. Once you have the requisite cross compiler set up, invoke
setup.sh with arm64 argument:

$ ./setup.sh arm64

This will set up qsim suitable to collect ARM64 information.
