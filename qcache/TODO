Qcache Todo List
----------------

- Write basic access() function for Cache.
- Write invalidate() function for Cache.
- Do basic performance evaluation and testing with a null coherence protocol.

- Write a directory class and a directory MOESI protocol.
  - Per-line locking.
  - No line can be evicted or have its state changed without locking. (Updating
    LRU information is fine)
  - Constraints:
    -Locking order: Block Locks(in directory), Set Locks in Core Order

- Mechanism to report results.

- Start some documentation. E.g., note that private L2 cache is not shared even 
  though it shares accesses from L1i and L1d. Why? Those accesses will never be
  simultaneous in with this implementation.

- Mechanism to handle timestamp overflows.
- Mechanism to forward invalidates to instruction caches.
