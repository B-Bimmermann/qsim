QSim Cache Model
================

The QSim cache model is a parallel functional model of a multiprocessor cache
with directory-based coherence, designed for reasonable (~10MIPS per host
thread) performance on modern multicore processors. The key feature of QCache is
that it enables the simulation of hundreds of "guest" cores on a smaller number
of host cores, while providing a model of all levels of cache.

1 - Getting Started
-------------------

Building QCache is a simple matter of running "make" with the QSIM_PREFIX
environment variable set correctly. QCache has no dependencies which QSim does
not have other than the QSim library itself. Building QCache with the default
makefile produces an executable called "qcache".

1.1 - Configuring QCache
------------------------

1.1.1 - Cache Parameters
------------------------

The parameters of the simulated cache are all configured at compile time for
the sake of performance. The set of typedefs at the top of main.cpp contains all
of the most important configuration parameters, provided as template parameters.

The four default typedefs are:

  typedef Qcache::CacheGrp<Qcache::CPNull,   4,  7, 6      > l1i_t;
  typedef Qcache::CacheGrp<Qcache::CPDirMesi,8,  6, 6      > l1d_t;
  typedef Qcache::CacheGrp<Qcache::CPNull,   8,  9, 6      > l2_t;
  typedef Qcache::Cache   <Qcache::CPNull,  24, 14, 6, true> l3_t;

These define the classes of each type of cache to be a specific instance of the
Qcache::Cache or Qcache::CacheGrp template. The arguments to these templates
are:

  template <template<int, typename> class CPROT_T, int WAYS, int L2SETS, 
           int L2LINESZ, bool SHARED=false>
    class Cache : public MemSysDev;

  template
    <template<int, typename> class CPROT_T, int WAYS, int L2SETS, int L2LINESZ>
    class CacheGrp : public MemSysDevSet;

CPROT_T  - Coherence Protocol type. Provided by Qcache::CPDirMesi
           (qcache-mesi.h), Qcache::CPDirMsi(qcache-msi.h), or Qcache::CPNull
           (qcache.h). Should only be set to a template other than
           Qcache::CPNull for the L1 data cache.
WAYS     - Number of ways in the cache.
L2SETS   - Base 2 logarithm of number of sets in the cache. 2 for 4 sets, 3 for
           8 sets, etc.
L2LINESZ - Base 2 logarithm of cache line size. Should be at least 3 as this is
           also the number of bits used to store the cache line state. Also
           cache lines smaller than 8 bytes lead to incorrect behavior. There is
           no mechanism to perform multiple cache accesses for a single load or
           store.
SHARED   - Set this to true for shared caches. Inserts appropriate locking and 
           coherence behavior for shared caches.

With this in mind, it should become clear that the four typedefs above define:

  L1i - Non-coherent, 4 ways, 2^7 sets, 2^6 bytes per line (32kB)
  L1d - Directory MESI, 8 ways, 2^6 sets, 2^6 bytes per line (32kB)
  L2  - 8 ways, 2^9 sets, 2^6 bytes per line (256kB)
  L3  - 24 ways, 2^14 sets, 2^6 bytes per line, shared (24MB)

1.1.2 - Cache Hierarchy
-----------------------

In order to change the organization of the cache hierarchy, it is necessary to
go deeper into the code, to where objects of these types are instantiated. The
representative lines from the default main.cpp are:

  Qcache::Tracer tracer(*traceOut);
  l3_t l3(tracer, "L3");
  l2_t l2(osd.get_n(), l3, "L2");
  l1d_t l1_d(osd.get_n(), l2, "L1d");
  l1i_t l1_i(osd.get_n(), l2, "L1i");

The arguments to these constructors are:

  Qcache::Tracer(std::ostream &tracefile);
  Qcache::Cache(Qcache::MemSysDev &lowerLevel, const char *name);
  Qcache::CacheGrp(int num, Qcache::MemSysDev &lowerLevel, const char *name);

The hierarchy is built from a Qcache::Tracer object connected to groups of
 higher-level caches. In Qcache, these caches cannot be an arbitrary tree. In
order for coherence to work correctly, all of the L1 caches must be members of
the same CacheGrp, and shared caches must be shared by all higher-level caches.

1.2 - Running QCache
--------------------

Running "qcache" with no commandline arguments provides a brief usage guide:

  qcache <state file> <benchmark tar file> <# host threads> [trace file]

The number of guest threads is determined by the state file used for input. The
number of host threads must divide evenly into this number. This makes using
core counts with a few large prime factors difficult, but why not use powers of
two like everybody else?

2 - Algorithms
--------------

2.1 - Synchronization
---------------------

There are two basic kinds of lock in the QSim cache model. There are "block"
locks associated with each cache block in the guest physical memory. These are
maintained as part of the coherence directory structure. There are also "set"
locks associated with each set in the cache. In order to do a lookup or modify
a set, a set lock must be held.

The locking order is first the block locks in order of cache ID and then any
one set lock. No two set locks ever need to be held simultaneously. Block locks
may need to be held simultaneously, e.g., when a line is being evicted.

3 - Code Organization
---------------------

3.1 - Files
-----------

main.cpp       - Main "driver" program. Instantiates QSim OSDomain and caches.
qcache.h       - Defines MemSysDev class, as well as class templates for Cache,
                 CacheGrp, and CPNull.
qcache.cpp     - Defines static/global variables for QCache. Currently, this is
                 a single global mutex used for error reporting.
qcache-dir.h   - Defines CoherenceDir template, used by the following coherence
                 ptotocols.
qcache-msi.h   - MSI coherence protocol, the CPDirMsi class template. Sets a
                 macro and re-includes qcache-mesi.h, where all three protocols
                 are defined.
qcache-mesi.h  - MESI coherence protocol, the CPDirMesi class template.
qcache-moesi.h - MOESI coherence protocol, the CPDirMoesi class template. Sets a
                 macro and re-includes qcache-moesi.h, where all three protocols
                 are defined.
qcache-repl.h  - Definitions of replacement policies, including 

The file qcache-msi.h is really just a wrapper for including qcache-mesi.h with
a single minor change to disable the 

3.2 - Classes and Templates
---------------------------

The class hierarchy in QCache is fairly flat. Due to the use of templates, the
coherence protocols can be thought of as subclasses of an implied (duck-typed)
coherence protocol class. The only class hierarchy is used for memory system
devices. Since lower levels of the cache hierarchy are only consulted during
misses, this was assumed to be an acceptable overhead in exchange for the
simplicity afforded.

  Qcache::MemSysDev         - "Memory system device" base class.

    Qcache::Cache<...>      - Cache class template.

    Qcache::Tracer          - Tracer. Used as the last level in the cache
                              hierarchy when a trace is the desired output.

  Qcache::CacheGrp<...>     - Cache group. The set of all private caches at the
                              same level of the hierarchy.

  Qcache::CoherenceDir<...> - Coherence directory; used by the directory
                              coherence protocols.

  Qcache::CPNull<...>       - Null coherence protocol; implements non-coherent
                              cache. Used for shared caches and uniprocessors.
  Qcache::CPDirMsi<...>     - MSI coherence protocol.
  Qcache::CPDirMesi<...>    - MESI coherence protocol. Always writes back lines
                              on M->S transition.
  Qcache::CPDirMoesi<...>   - MOESI coherence protocol. Only writes back lines
                              on eviction.

  Qcache::ReplRand<...>     - Random replacement.
  Qcache::ReplLRU<...>      - LRU replacement with MRU insertion.
  Qcache::ReplLRU_LIP<...>  - LRU replacement with LRU insertion policy.
  Qcache::ReplLRU_BIP<...>  - LRU replacement with bimodal insertion policy.
  Qcache::ReplLRU_DIP<...>  - LRU replacement with dynamic insertion policy.
  Qcache::ReplSRRIP<...>    - Static re-reference interval predcition. (See
                              Jaleel 2010)
  Qcache::ReplBRRIP<...>    - Bimodal re-reference interval prediction.
  Qcache::ReplDRRIP<...>    - Dynamic re-reference interval prediction.

  Qcache::ReplLRUBase<...>  - Master class for LRU replacement policies. Imple-
                              ment MIP, LIP, BIP, and DIP.

                              ments DRRIP, BRRIP, and SRRIP.
  Qcache::SetDueler<...>    - Selects leader sets and keeps PSEL counter for set
                              dueling.
