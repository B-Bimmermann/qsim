  <h2>About QSim</h2>
  <p>
    QSim is a project which aims, as part of the Manifold simulation effort at
    Georgia Tech, to create a thread safe multicore emulation library based on 
    the QEMU emulator. QSim provides instruction-level control of the emulated
    environment and detailed information about the executing instruction stream.
    X86 Linux guests are supported with hundreds of emulated hardware contexts,
    each of which can run in an independent host thread. Applications of QSim
    include trace-gathering, multithreaded software development, and its primary
    target: microarchitecture simulation.

  <p>
    QSim requires an x86-64 Linux host to run and currently only supports x86-32
    Linux guests.

  <h2>Getting QSim</h2>
  <p>
    Releases can be found <a href="releases/">here</a>. The most recent of these is
    your best bet for getting a stable QSim system running.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most recent code can always be found on the
    <a href="http://sst.sandia.gov/">SST</a> Google Code repository, and downloaded
    with:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <tt>svn checkout https://sst-simulator.googlecode.com/svn/qsim/trunk qsim</tt>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    For instructions on building QSim, see the file <tt>INSTALL</tt> in the root
    source directory. This is a brief runlog of commands needed to get QSim
    running.
  </p>

  <h2>Development</h2>

        A QEMU-based multicore emulator with support for up to 255 cores running
        in parallel. Uses a similar design to QSim, provides emulated PC
        hardware, but does not provide an instrumentation API with
        instruction-level execution control.
