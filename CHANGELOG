0.1 - pre3

* First multicore (fixed dual-core) QSIM library to boot Linux and provide
  full API with queues and atomic instruction callbacks.

* First draft of documentation.

0.1 - pre4

* Added support for arbitrary numbers of cores.

* Finished documenting the Qsim::QemuCpu class.

* Fixed bug that was causing inter-processor interrupts to be dropped if more
  than one was sent, or if the timer interrupt was sent before the IPI was 
  handled.

* Broken multithreaded support. Needs overhaul inside and outside of QEMU to
  prevent race conditions in simulations with large number of processors.

* Started work on the QSIM Trace Machine, qtm, a multithreaded trace generator
  for workload analysis.

0.1 - pre5

* Fixed a bug that was causing inocorrect physical addresses to be generated
  for instruction callbacks.

* Improved stability; boots and runs benchmark without deadlock every time.

* Gave sample applications, 'hacks', a separate build directory, populated with
  symlinks to allow running directly from this directory.

* Introduced "vistrace.cpp", a program for creating visual representations of
  memory access patterns.

* Made the temporary file system somewhat more robust. Multiple QSIM instances
  can now be run simultaneously in the same working directory. There are still
  unlikely-to-be-encountered race conditions with temporary filenames, though.
  (see BUGS for details)

0.1 - pre6

* Now successfully boots and runs programs with more than 8 CPUs.

* CPU threads in QTM will now run in parallel. Atomic operations are (must be)
  protected by a readers/writer lock. (The atomic operation is the "writer",
  all threads not executing atomic operations are the "readers".)

* Ctrl+C now works as expected.

* Added a preliminary debugger, QDB (with its own laundry list of bugs). This
  will eventually be spun off as a separate project.

0.1 - pre7

* Fixed a major bug in the initialization of synchronization variables that 
  caused infrequent lock-ups on start.

* Application start and end magic CPUIDs (0xaaaaaaaa, 0xfa11dead)

* QDB commandline interface started (still *very* alpha).

0.1 - pre8

* Added configurable RAM size.

* Replaced inefficient OS swapcontext with qsim-context.h implementation. This
  takes the single-stepping speed from 1.5MIPS to a far more tolerable 6.3MIPS.

* Added return value to interrupt callbacks. They can now return nonzero on
  trap instructions to circumvent the normal interrupt handlers. This can be
  used to simulate hardware traps in software.

* Added value field to "out" instruction helpers in QEMU. This allows simple
  emulation of I/O ports using I/O callbacks.

* Load callbacks now happen before the load takes place, and store callbacks
  following the store. This way, the value being loaded can be modified or the
  value being stored replaced.

* Added a new callback system to CDomain that allows for chaining of multiple
  callbacks, each of which can be an arbitrary class member function.

* Renamed CDomain to OSDomain. "Coherence domain" as a name for this structure
  was somewhere between misleading and just plain wrong.

* Fixed 255 CPU limit, finally. Now the limit is based on external software and
  hardware constraints.

0.1

* Busybox, Linux, and QEMU are now grabbed from upstream and distributed as
  patchsets.

* Added register callbacks

* Added instructon type to instruction callbacks.

* Introduced simplesim simulator back end.

* Re-worked the Linux port.

* Introduced remote/ for distributed operation.

* Introduced qsim-fastforwarder and saved state.
 
* Introduced qsim-io to transfer files to the guest.

* Removed the benchmarks from the main source directory.

* Fixed a ton of minor issues and bugs.

0.1.1

* Running QSim no longer requires access to the QEMU source directory in order
  to open the (unused) PC BIOS image.

* The build process now downloads BusyBox by script (it is no longer included
  in the distribution).

* Callbacks setters now return handles, which can be used to un-set callbacks.

* Benchmarks can now be loaded from .tar images through qsim-io. The
  QSim::load_file() function in qsim-load.h provides this functionality.

* The benchmarks are no longer part of the main repository, and building kernel
  images is no longer a required part of the QSim build process.

0.1.2

* Fixed compiler specific crashes.

* Added script to make tarballs.

* Fixed bug in set_reg() for flags register.
