QSim 64-bit Linux Kernel
========================

The goal of the x86-64 incarnation of QSim is to use an unmodified operating
system with minimal custom configuration. Toward this end, the 64-bit QSim
kernel is simply a copy of the most recent stable Linux kernel at the time of
writing (3.5.2) with a simple custom configuration.
