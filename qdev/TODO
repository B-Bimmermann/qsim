QDev Device Support To-Do List
==============================

_ Add a state to QSim to handle the "HALT" instruction. This should cause run()
  to return prematurely and continue to return 0 untill there is an interrupt.

_ Do some basic 8259 emulation.

_ Add a mechanism to QSim to allow I/O port reads ("IN" instructions) to
  receive values from the I/O callback (memory already has the
  write-to-physical-address mechanism).

_ Do some PCI emulation.

_ Write the APIC.
