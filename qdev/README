QDev Device Emulation Infrastructure
====================================

Since QSim no longer supports device drivers or has a working BIOS, running
unmodified kernels is not supported and transitioning to 64 bits, despite QEMU
support for this, is difficult. To make the transition, we are going to try to
create a layer, "QDev" that will add thread safe device support back to QSim,
and add a debug mode that traps and prompts for all unexpected memory and I/O
accesses.
