* Temporary files are not deleted when a QSIM-using program exits, unexpectedly
  or otherwise. Attempts to delete the files, even after they are dlclosed()
  have caused bus errors. This could perhaps be fixed by a cleanup function.

* The temporary filenames created in mgzd.h are not safe. The tempnam() 
  function is used for their creation, which leads to a race condition. 
  Unfortunately, there is no easy way around this in file systems that do not
  support file locking: dlopen() requires a filename, not just a file 
  descriptor or pointer to a FILE structure.

* Loads must be performed twice within QEMU in order to maintain proper
  semantics. This is more a kludge than a bug (no incorrect behavior).

* There is currently no way to broadcast a translation cache flush. This means
  that one CPU can overwrite code that another has already cached and this
  change will not propagate. Luckily this seems to be rare.

* The server doesn't handle application exit gracefully. It should probably
  also exit, since no further instructions will be needed. Otherwise, it
  continues to run after the client exists, creating a problem.
