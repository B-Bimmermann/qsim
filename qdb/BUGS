* Profiler uses statistical sampling with a fixed mean instructions between 
  samples of 1000000. This should be configurable.
* Watchpoints and breakpoints not implemented. 
* Trace and Memtr not implemented.
* Step not implemented.
* Dumps, disassemblies, and setting of invalid virtual addressess cause SIGSEGV
  within QEMU. A gentler warning would be much preferred.
* Dumps and disassemblies are not paginated, so they scroll off the top of the
  screen if they are longer than the terminal is high.
